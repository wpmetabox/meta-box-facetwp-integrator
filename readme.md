## Description

**MB FacetWP Integration** is a free plugin that integrates [Meta Box](https://metabox.io) and [FacetWP](https://facetwp.com), which makes custom fields of Meta Box searchable and filterable in the frontend.

For an e-commerce or a listing website, the product or listing requires custom data such as price, location, color, etc. And users need to search or filter the products / listings in the frontend based on these criteria.

- With the help of Meta Box, you can create any kind of data (custom fields) for your product / listing or any custom post type.
- And FacetWP will make products / listings searchable, filterable by those data.

This plugin doesn't require any configuration. Just install it and you will see Meta Box custom fields appear in the list of options in FacetWP settings.
